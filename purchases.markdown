If you're not paying for it they you are the product. Creating a catalog of services, apps, and content that I am happy to pay for to keep them alive

## Podcasts and Content

Show | Notes

[The Age of Napoleon](https://www.patreon.com/ageofnapoleon/posts) | A great history podcast covering the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, I got introduced to the era via the [Revolutions Podcast's](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) season on the French and Hatian revolutions. I wated to hear more about what was happening in France.
[The Young Turks](https://tyt.com/join) | The largest online news channel that delivers a 2 hour show each weekday covering issues from an independent perspective. 



## SaaS and Apps

Tool | Notes
---- | ------
[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) | I have a yearly subscriptiion to this RSS reader that's the sucsessor to Google Reader. It's great to have one place where my feeds come together. Also has a great feature where Feedly will generate a unique email address for sites which don't support RSS feeds so you can sign up for email newsletters.
[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) | I have a yearly subscription to this  combination of email, calendar, and contact list which alllowed me to move away from Gmail as my primary mail server. It also supports the ability to have wildcard domains for email so in addition to a unique password for each site you can also have a unique email for each site. There's good intergration with iOS for contact/mail/calendar sync. [Referal code](https://ref.fm/u25120976)
[Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) | A password manager that allows you to have a unique password for each website that you generate. It's reputation in the community isn't the best. However, it's solid enough, and my familiy has standardized on it so I pay for it on a yearly basis.


## Hardware

Device | Notes
----- | ------
[Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) | A great split keyboard which allows you to have space between your hands while you work. Transfering to a split keyboard layout is helpful for me to be ready to type for the rest of my career. This allows for multiple layers and keyboard macros to be programed ins
[Model 01 Keyboard â€“ Keyboardio](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-01-keyboard?variant=30996744405065) | Another split keyboard, and an actual kickstarter product which was shipped to me. This allows for multiple layers and keyboard macros to be programed ins
[Kensington Expert Mouse Wireless Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/electronic-control-solutions/trackball-products/expert-mouse-wireless-trackball-1/) | A trackball helps keep your wrists in a natural position. This one is a big and comftorable for daily use. However, if I were buying it again I would go with the wired version
