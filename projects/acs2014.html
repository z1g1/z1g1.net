		<p class="lead"><a href="http://web2.facs.org/cc_program_planner/Detail_Session_2014.cfm?CCYEAR=2014&SESSION=SC08&GROUP=SC&KEYWORD=Social%20Networking%20for%20Surgeons%3F">Social Media for Surgeons (#SM4S)</a> was presented at the ACS 2014 confrence in San Francisco, CA. The focus of this hands-on course is how surgeons can use health care social media (#HCSM) (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google+ , etc.) in their daily lives to enhance patient care and outcomes, medical student (#UME) and resident (#GME) education, career development (#CME) and personal networking. Topics include: why surgeons need to understand #HCSM, the ABCs of safe #HCSM and the XYZ’s of cyber-security, using #HCSM for #GME, #CME, surgical leadership, patient care and how #HCSM can make you a better surgeons. The use of a real time, live twitter feed will allow attendees to actively engage in the course and see their comments onscreen. Speakers will emphasize the paradigm shifting concept that all surgical presentations can be summarized as 140 character (#140char) tweets (#pearls & #TTHM (the take home message), reach a larger audience more quickly and be the “new” #impactfactor for academicians. Participants will be given the tools to develop their knowledge and skill sets for using social media on all continuums of #SM4S. Learning to use #HCSM to its maximal effectiveness will offer users the skills needed to provide added value to patient care and outcomes, teach effectively at various levels (#SoMed), leverage leadership positions and communicate more effectively to all constituents. This hands-on experience will allow attendees one-on-one tutorials with faculty to ensure participants are comfortable using their working Twitter accounts by the course conclusion. All participants should bring a mobile device with Wi-Fi capabilities in order to maximize their experience. This course is intended for a blended audience of #HCSM experience (from the novice to advanced level).
