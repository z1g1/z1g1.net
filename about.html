<p class="lead">Information Security Professional,  Crossfit novice, Concerned Citizen</p>

<p>Born in San Francisco, grown in Buffalo, educated in Syracuse, currently living in North Virginia Working for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> as a Security Support Engineer.  My past work experiences have been in Providence, RI working for <a href="http://www.secureworks.com/">Dell SecureWorks</a> as a Sr. Security Operations Center analyst and for the <a href="http://www.syracusecityschools.com/">Syracuse City School District</a>. 

<p>I decided on Information Security as a career after a rather circuitous path.  Which began as a dual Education/US History undergraduate major at <a href="http://sry.edu">Syracuse University</a> which after a few student teaching experiences I determined was not for me.  I drifted as a liberal arts major without a career path for a few semesters, though I did add a Political Science major to make up for losing the education. During this time I answered a Career Services Center email address to work as a summer intern in Washington DC.  This program run by the <a href="http://www.aapd.com">AAPD</a>, assigned me to work in the ofice of them Majority Leader <a href="http://hoyer.house.gov/">Steny Hoyer</a>.  While working in this office under technical Director Steve Dwyer I was bit by the political bug as well as showing me how I could turn my interest in technology into a potential career.  Steve's advice if I wanted to return to DC as a technology policy advocate was to earn a Masters Degree in the field and keep plugged into the political scene.  To further this goal I returned to Syracuse and began my studies in Information Management at the <a href="http://ischool.syr.edu/">School of Information Studies at Syracuse University</a> and worked as an Intern in the local office for New York's Senior Senator <a href="http://www.schumer.senate.gov/">Charles Schumer</a>.  After Graduate School I worked as the <a href="http://www.syracusecityschools.com/">Syracuse City School District</a>, <a href="http://www.secureworks.com/">Dell SecureWorks</a> as a Sr. Security Operations Center analyst, and my latest position with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>.Though I am still interested in politics I found I enjoyed the work, community and culture of the Information Security sphere to be more interesting.  Though the field of Information Security isn't much older than my career in it, as a constantly evolving space it offers great prospects for the future. </p>

<p>When I am not at work I enjoy hitting the table top for some <a href="http://privateerpress.com/">Warmachine & Hordes</a> or <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=207&enmi=Android:%20Netrunner%20The%20Card%20Game">Android: Netrunner</a>, kicking back on my porch with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA">Kindle</a>
,having my heart broken by my hometown <a href="http://buffalobills.com/">Buffalo Bills</a> and <a href="http://sabres.nhl.com/">Buffalo Sabres</a>.</p>
