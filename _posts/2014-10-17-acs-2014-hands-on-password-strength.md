## Summary
A strong password has a large keyspace which increases the entropy of the password.  The more entropic a password is the more resistance it is to brute forcing.  These passwords can be difficult to remember but by utilizing a [password manager](http://z1g1.net/2014/10/18/acs-2014-hands-on-password-managers.html) you can generate and store a strong unique password unique for each site.

## ACS Learning Objective
* Posts have Consequences

## The Numbers
* The entropy of a password is calculated as, the character set is raised to the power of the password length
* More characters creates an exponential increase in password strength with a password of the same length

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Character Set</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>26</td>
		<td>a-z</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>52</td>
		<td>A-Z and a-z</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>62</td>
		<td>A-Z, a-z, and 0-9</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>72</td>
		<td>A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, )</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Conclusion
* Utilize a password generator to help generate strong passwords with high entropy.  Utilize a password manager to store a unique password per site
