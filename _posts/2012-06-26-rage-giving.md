<p>I am a big fan of <a href="http://smarterware.org/">Gina Tripani</a> from her work on <a href="http://twit.tv/twig">TWIG</a> and when she announced that she was teaming up with Kevin Purdy of <a href="http://Lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a> fame to work on a podcast that would focus more on development and on the agile development process I knew that it would be worth adding it to my BeyondPod feed.</p>

<p>Their show <a href="http://5by5.tv/inbeta/">In Beta</a> has been around for four episodes now and they really have found a good grove and both hosts have an excellent flow together.  In addition to both host's great input on the application development process the feature of the show I appreciate the most have been the host's commitment to keeping the show tight on time.  You can really tell that both Gina and Kevin put a lot of preparation into the show before the recording track starts.</p>

<h2>Rage Giving</h2>

<p>In episode 4 of <a href="http://5by5.tv/inbeta/4">In Beta</a> Gina and Kevin were discussing the public shaming of bullies and how the rise of group funding services like <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a> and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">KickStarter</a> have allowed for people to connect their rage which a browser tab generated and funnel it into an action of donation.  Gina brought up the fact that while she is glad that money is being generated for good causes she expressed her concern that the money might be better spent going to a charity like <a href="http://eff.org">The EFF</a>.  </p>

<p>As I listened along I felt that she made a good point. A rage donation is made in the heat of the moment before the story is finished.  The 3rd party payment site retains your pervious payment information and before your tab is closed money has been donated.  Making sure that money gets to the right place is important and I would recomend, no matter what your politics, that you check out <a href="http://dailykos.com/">DailyKos</a> and thier use of <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/">ActBlue</a> donation widgets directly on a controersial story.  When a site reader encounters a story which enflames thier passion awidget is there to funnel that into a donation.  By using a 3rd party the checkout process if very quick, transparent and most importantly easy!</p>

<p>As the EFF was mentioned I went to thier <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate">donation page</a> and they do have a way to pay with a 3rd party (PayPal in this case) which can haness this need to rage donate.  Perhaps the EFF needs to create a widget which can be embeded right in a story about the next attack on Internet Freedom.</p>

<p>Keep up the great work Gina and Kevin I know that your podcast will continue to entertain and keep me thinking!</p>
