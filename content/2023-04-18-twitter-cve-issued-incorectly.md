On 2023/03/31 Twitter [decided to publish](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm) some of the source code for it's algorithm. Others have [discussed](https://moderated-content.simplecast.com/episodes/mc-weekly-update-4-3-behold-the-algorithm-or-parts-of-it-sort-of) what the publishing of this code did or did not show. This post is about the  [CVE-2023-29218](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29218) which was filled by *someone* based on the code that Twitter posted to Github. The CVE was filed as a denial of service vulnerability, as it claimed that coordinated effort could cause a reduction in reach of a tweet due to the algorithm implementing a "shadow ban". This CVE should not have been issued as there is no way for users to take action on the CVE.


## CVE Counting Rules


The [CVE system](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview) is setup as a way for identifying and tracking publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and security exposures in software and hardware products. Once a CVE number is issued it is the unique ID for a specific security issue. This allows practitioners to standardize on the naming and tracking of known vulnerabilities, making it easier to exchange information and mitigate issues.


The issuing of CVEs  by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) are governed by [section 7 of the CVE Counting Rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_7_assignment_rules). These rules lay out the guidance that CNA staff make use of to determine if a request for a CVE should be approved. One of the key considerations is rule 7.4.5.2, that a "CNAs MUST NOT assign a CVE ID to a vulnerability if the affected product(s) or service(s): **Are not customer controlled**." This rule is in place to ensure that CVEs are actionable (emphasis mine)


There has been [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwDo6KG76_c) about the need for a CVE-like unique identifier for issues which are explicitly server side. Issues that are discovered in cloud and SaaS do exist and when they do there is often only a [code](https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-glue-vulnerability/) [name](https://chaosdb.wiz.io/) to identify them. Customers have to ask their vendors if they have mitigated the codenamed issue.


Though this is a gap in our industry's vulnerability management process, the CVE Counting Rules are explicit that a CVE must not be issued if an issue is not controlled by the customer.


## CVE-2023-29218


Based on rule 6.4.5.2 CVE-2023-29218 is a mistake and should be retracted via the (dispute process)[https://www.cve.org/Resources/General/Policies/CVE-Record-Dispute-Policy.pdf] (warning pdf link). The version number in the description give us our first hints that this issue cannot be mitigated by customers.


> The Twitter Recommendation Algorithm through ec83d01 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (reduction of reputation score) by arranging for multiple Twitter accounts to coordinate negative signals regarding a target account, such as unfollowing, muting, blocking, and reporting, as exploited in the wild in March and April 2023.


Where does this 'ec83d01' come from? This is not an internal version number at Twitter. It is the git commit hash for the [code Twitter published on Github](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/tree/ec83d01dcaebf369444d75ed04b3625a0a645eb9). There is no way to know if the Twitter.com you're using is running version a recommendation algorithm through version ec83d01. There is no action that an end user receiving this CVE can take any action based on this information.


Built into the issue with knowing the running version of Twitter's current algorithm, this CVE is also not actionable to the user reading it. There are sometimes when a CVE can be issued for a system that is not customer controlled. In rule 7.4.4.2-3 CNAs MAY assign a CVE ID to a vulnerability if: The product or service is not customer controlled, **and The vulnerability requires customer or peer action to resolve**. (emphasis mine)" However, in this case there's no configuration change, or action that a user can take to mitigate the supposed availability risk. The control is explicitly on the Twitter side of the this issue. There is a [discussion thread](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/issues/1386) on Github about ways that Twitter could change their algorithm to mitigate potential issues. As of publishing this thread is still open and not actioned by Twitter.


### A note on Vulnerability Scoring


The [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) is used as a part of the CVE process to help vulnerability management teams prioritize and triage inbound vulnerabilities. The system is based on 8 criteria: Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required, User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). These values are [used](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document) to generate a score between 0.0 (low) and 10.0 (high).


CVE-2023-29218 is currently registered in the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29218) with a score of 7.5. The entry shares how the requestor of the CVE rates their discovery:
```
CVSS v3.1 Severity and Metrics:


Base Score: 7.5 HIGH
Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
Impact Score: 3.6
Exploitability Score: 3.9


Attack Vector (AV): Network
Attack Complexity (AC): Low
Privileges Required (PR): None
User Interaction (UI): None
Scope (S): Unchanged
Confidentiality (C): None
Integrity (I): None
Availability (A): High
```


Though the output of CVSS is a quantitative score, how it is created is a qualitative exercise. Vendors and researchers can engage in discussions about how they rate various aspects of the finding. The CVSS [user guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide) provides information about how each of these areas should be evaluated.


In the case of CVE-2023-29218 the score of High 7.5 is manufactured by combining a Network Attack Vector, with a Low Attack Complexity, Privileges Required of None, and User Interaction of None. A Network Attack vector raises the CVSS score because it is easy for attackers to reach a network resource vs requiring local, or network access. Privileges Required and User Interaction of None raise the CVSS score because they remove the ability for defenders to deploy a mitigation or to rely on defense in depth

The score is further heightened by indicating an impact to Availability of High. For an item to score this it means, "There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component..." In the most generous reading of a "shadow ban" the Twitter content is still visible online at it's same URL, it is only not recommended into the Twitter "For You" tab. A more generous scoring of this issue is Low, "...the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users." Modification of this one value reduces the score to a Medium 5.3

This Twitter CVE as scored in the NVD has the same 7.5 score as [CVE-2014-0160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160), better known as Heartbleed. Even if this CVE should have been issued, this CVSS score is inflated.


## Conclusion


CVEs are an important tool for tracking and mitigating vulnerabilities, they should only be issued for vulnerabilities that can be remediated by end-users. For an issue that can only be mitigated by a service provider a CVE should not be issued. There is no action that a security team receiving this CVE can take. The CVE system is not a system for measuring clout, or declaring that something is a real problem. They are a tool for defenders in the security space. CVE-2023-29218 doesn't help anyone defend their assets, and should not have been issued.
